- [ ] The project includes a custom non-RESTful route with corresponding controller actions
- [x] The user can filter or sort items based on particular criteria as appropriate for your use case
- [ ] Data is automatically generated in response to a certain event or user action. Examples include generating a default inventory for a new user starting a game or creating a starter set of tasks for a user creating a new task app account
- [x] Data submitted via a POST or PATCH request is validated before the database is updated (e.g. validating that an event is in the future before allowing a new event to be created)
  - [x] *To receive full credit, please be sure to demonstrate in your walkthrough that for certain inputs, the item will NOT be successfully created or updated.*

## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Our team did a solid job turning the backend CRUD foundation into a usable full-stack app experience this unit. We shipped a React dashboard with dynamic routes, a same-page add/edit modal flow, filtering + sorting controls, shelves, tags, validation, loading states, and a detail route for books. We also tightened up README documentation so new teammates can run both backend and frontend quickly.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

The biggest challenge was scope control. We originally planned extra relational features including full reading groups, while still needing to complete core milestone tasks and documentation. We handled that by prioritizing stable baseline features first, finishing shelves and tags, and leaving clearly-labeled stretch tasks unchecked unless they were actually implemented.

### 3. What were some of the highlights or achievements that you are most proud of in this project?

A highlight was delivering an end-to-end user flow: users can view books, create new ones, edit existing books in a modal, delete entries, assign shelves and tags, filter by reading status/shelf/tag, and open a dedicated detail page via dynamic routing. We are also proud that reset scripts and API validation are documented and working for demo preparation.

### 4. Reflecting on your web development journey so far, how have you grown since the beginning of the course?

Since the beginning of the course, we have grown from building isolated components to thinking in complete systems: database schema, API contracts, frontend state management, and user experience tradeoffs. We now approach features with clearer planning and better separation of concerns between UI and server logic.

### 5. Looking ahead, what are your goals related to web development, and what steps do you plan to take to achieve them?

Our goals are to (1) finish Render deployment, (2) record the final walkthrough GIF, and (3) keep polishing reliability with stronger tests and clearer demo data. To get there, we will continue issue-based planning, deploy with the documented Render commands, seed production data, and record walkthrough GIFs as each feature is completed.
